By Partho, Gaea News Network
Wednesday, March 18, 2009Business around the world undergo dynamic changes contingent to market economics. Industries like banking and insurance are most vulnerable stooges of market changes and need to develop plans to deal with such exigencies. The business rule engines have emerged as solution for such anomalies generating a set of tools that allow the business analysts and developers to build decision logic based on an organization’s data. Basically, a business rule is considered as a statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. These rules are used to control or influence the business’s behavior. Generally the rule engines evaluates and executes the rules with if-then statements. This allows the separation of knowledge from its implementation logic and can be modified without changing source code.
These Java business rule engines are software system that executes one or more business rules in a runtime production environment. The Java rule engine has been developed through the Java Community Process (JCP) program. The specification for the Java Rule Engine API (JSR 94) that defines a Java runtime API for rule engines by providing a simple API to access a rule engine from a Java Platform(Standard or Enterprise edition). The rule engines reduces an application’s maintenance as well as extensibility costs, lowering the complexity of components that implement complex business logic.
